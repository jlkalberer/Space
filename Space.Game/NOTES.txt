Solar Systems
	usercan have gas giant as center
	can have gas giant orbiting spatial entity
	gas giants can be converted into stars
	stars can go supernova

	white dwarf
	black holes mess with Detectors

Planets

		Users can also trade on the "black market" but this is illegal and the Federation will fine/attack  the planet from which the cargo left and where it is heading


Fleets
	Can be combined so that Warriors can protect traders
	Can build detectors to see other fleets - message/email/text will be sent to user telling them that they can attack and who it is if the fleet that was found has not lowered their flag(s)
		Can be used when hiding in asteroid belts in order to get the drop on other players
		Detectors give the estimated trajectory of fleets -- fleets may be set to always run away to cut losses when attacked. Transports are slower so they may not escape from attacking fleets.
		Detectors can be viewed by raday and easily destroyed.
